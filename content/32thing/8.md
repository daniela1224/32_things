## You are brave:eight_spoked_asterisk:
![Brave](/images/brave3.jpg)

    Words that come to my mind when I think about how brave you are: Discipline, confidence, energy, vulnerability, serendipity. 


**Brave** was the first word I assigned to you when I saw you in Stusie for the very first time. Then, rude and annoying followed but that's another story, hehe. As a fellow abandoner of certain paths in life, you know I admire you for wanting to explore more of what's out there for you.
